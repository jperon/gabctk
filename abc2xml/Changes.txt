Version 71
- Added new option --meta to allow users to specify a mapping of ABC info fields to MusicXML meta data elements.
  Depending on the music editor used, some info fields may get a reasonable position onto the front page of the score
- The first T: infofield is translated to the MusicXML work-title element. Subsequent T: fields are concatenated onto
  the the MusicXML work-number element. In Finale and MuseScore the work-number is displayed in a smaller font
  below the work title.
- Multiple ABC info fields of the same type are concatenated with a new line as separator.
- When the -t option is used ontly the first T: info field is used as file name.

Version 70
- ABC meta data that is not supported in MusicXML is translated into <miscellaneous> elements.
  Previously this data was put into <credit> elements. However, <credit> elements are only meant for formatted display
  of data. Writing metadata without formatting into <credit> elements (as abc2xml did) inhibited display of other
  important data, like title, composer or lyricist.
- new option -t causes abc2xml to use the tune title as file name. Useful for multi tune files.

Version 69
- Remove redundant instrument definitions and tags from a multi voice part. Redundant instrument definitions can arise
  when ABC voices with identical midi instruments are mapped onto one (grand) staff.
- Duration of a tremolo pair is internally doubled, because MusicXML considers tremolo pairs as duplets (two notes in
  the time of one) and halves the duration again.
  Thus !//-!A2A2 is internally !//-!A4A4 and is translated as (2:1:2 A4A4 which has the same duration as A2A2 but the
  noteheads are those of an A4.

Version 68
- The vertical postition of a note specified with the staff step value in I:percmap, no longer depends on the current clef.
  the staff step now always refers to the vertical note position with a treble clef.
- When slurs close and open at the same note, the closing slurs are treated first.

Version 67
- %%MIDI instrument/channel changes translated to (text) directions in xml (works with Finale Notepad)
- implementation of I:percmap <abc-note> <staff-step> <midi-number> <xml-notehead> (Proposal by Alexander Scheutzow)
  See readme.txt for description of syntax, usage and semantics.
- %%MIDI drummap is translated to an equivalent I:percmap
- The octave= parameter was not recognized without a clef= in the same line (for both V: and K:)
- The octave= required a signed number +n of -n. Now the + sign is optional.
- translate stafflines attribute. (no correction for display-step yet)
- translation of %%MIDI rationalized.

Version 66
- deleted the code for the post-fix meaning of closing decorations. A decoration now always refers to the following
  note (even if it is in the next measure). The only exception is the slur closing bracket.
- replace illegal values of L: with default values (caused exception)
- replace illegal values of Q: with default values (caused exception)
- correctly parse multiple fields of V: (some fields were discarded)

Version 65
- multiple note tremolo decoration translated: !/-!, !//-! and !///-! (see readme.txt for details)
- an xml metronome element is only generated when a numeric tempo is present (e.g. Q: 1/4=108).
- when a Q: field only contains text, a hidden tempo value is derived (using tempo map from abc2midi).
- removed special grammar for decorations of chord notes
- removed special grammar for decorations before barline. The position of segno, coda and fine is now always at the
  correct side of the measure in which they are defined, independent of their ABC-position within that measure.
- move closing decorations in front of the note they belong to (postfix to prefix).

Version 64
- single tremolo decoration translated: !/!, !//! and !///!
- glissando decoration translated: !-(! ... !-)! and !~(! ... !~)! (Proposal by Alexander Scheutzow)
- added translations for !plus! or !+!
- text in Q: fields is added as text to the xml tempo direction.

Version 63
- changed the pageformat defaults to those of abcm2ps (A4) in stead of those used in MuseScore.
- in the -p command line option (page format) changed the "space" parameter (MuseScore) to the "scale" parameter (abcm2ps)
- python version test also works with python2.6 (caused an exeption previously).

Version 62
- mxl output was broken (option -z)
- clefs could be set to the wrong type when a type designation happened to occur in a name="..." string.
- small code change for compatibility with EasyABC's interface to abc2xml.

Version 61
- program can run with either Python 2.6, 2.7 or Python 3.x. (Python 3.4 runs 17% slower than 2.7 on my regression set)

Version 60
- use lyric alignment as defined in the 2.1 standard.
  Lyric lines are parsed as normal inlined information fields. (suggested by Alexander Scheutzow).
- integrate lyric grammar into the main abc grammar (was a separate grammer previously).
- only base name of input path is used when combined with the -o directory path. (correction P.Villiger)
- skip illegal user defined symbols (with warning) in stead of raising a syntax exception.

Version 59
- allow X: without number or with arbitrary textstring
- allow Y: information field
- the -r option is consequently passed as parameter to keep functions referentially transparent. (was a global variable)
- corrected error message for illegal use of U:

Version 58
- grammar for I:score instruction replaces ad hoc parsing.
- voice merging, part grouping and grand staffs are derived by transformation of the parse tree of I:score.
- also move clef redefinitions after [I:staff +/-n].
- avoid a false beam break when [I:staff +/-n] is used within a beamed note group.
- absolute staff numbers in [I:staff n] are mapped to MusicXML grand staff numbers (when possible) for reasons
  of compatibility with abcm2ps. Usage of absolute staff numbers is discouraged.
- added translation of the [+-^_]15 octave clefs.
- no default channel/panning/volume in <midi-instrument> elements.

Version 57
- grand staff implemented.
- in an [I:score] instruction recognize a braced voice group as a grand staff when the opening brace is followed by
  an asterix ('{*' no space allowed, syntax proposed by Alexander Scheutzow).
- also recognize a normal braced voice group as a grand staff when precisely one of the braced voices has a name.
- the name of a staff or part is taken from the first of its voices (in ABC source order) for which a name is defined.
- within a grand staff notes and directions preceded by [I:staff +/-n] are moved n staffs upwards or downwards.
- accept voice ids with a leading asterix in I:score instructions (for the time being the asterix is discarded, however)

Version 56
- the <grace/> element should come before the <chord/> element in a note. (previously caused syntax warning with FinaleNotepad)
- translates the _8, ^8 variants of the clefs in addition to the +8, -8. Also translates octave= argument of V: and K:
- part names are left empty when not explicitly given using V:id name="<part name>" (previously id was used in that case)
- transpose= was only honoured when a typed clef= definition was present, now is works in any V: or K: field.
- a tempo definition in the ABC header (Q:) is treated as an inline tempo ([Q:]) for the first voice.
- repeated occurrences of [I:MIDI] in a voice are translated into a MusicXML instrument changes for that voice.
  Neither Finale nor Musescore recognize the relevant MusicXML elements (<sound/midi-instrument> and <note/instrument> yet.
- new cue=on/off attribute for K: and V: definitions, to mark sections of cue notes in a voice (proposed by Alexander Scheutzow).
  Neither Finale nor Musescore handle cue size for directions, yet (<level size="cue">).
- normally whole measure rests are discarded when merging staffs. Use option -r to keep these rests in the merged results.

Version 55
- replaced info message text: "leeg" with "empty voice", when skipping an empty voice.
- avoided exception when ABC voice has only one measure containing only a volta number
- do not output an xml-backup element when it has zero duration

Version 54
- allow gracenotes within chords
- discard unbalanced chord brackets (caused a syntax error previously)
- chords containing only rests caused an exception
- ABC-code like: B2 1 caused an exception, now interpreted as: B2/1

Version 53
- tie to a chord with a single note caused an exception.
- a first line with a single measure and only a left bar line caused a syntax error.
- a first line with a single measure with only chords and no bar lines caused a syntax error.
- option -z or --mxl writes an additional compressed xml file with extention .mxl
- better treatment of barlines with spaces interspersed.
- dot after note right before barline caused syntax error (now only warning and skip)

Version 52
- accept and translate chords in a grace sequence (caused an exception previously)
- corrected bug when parsing %%score without space between voice number and left bracket, like %%staves 1(2 3)

Version 51
- treat abc file without any X: as a single tune and prepend X:1
- recognize alto4 as alternative notation for tenor clef

Version 50
- corrected translation of the clef octave change notation (i.e. +8, -8 suffix)

Version 49
- ties between different pitches are converted to slurs (previously the tie in 'A-B A' would extend
to the second A, now there will be a slur between A and B).
- do not add accidentals to tied notes even when present in ABC code.
- use consistent voice numbering in XML when merging ABC-voices with overlays.

Version 48
- M: field with more than one slash caused an exception.
- limit shortest note durations to 1/64
- skip redundant closing slurs (caused exception previously)
- check instrument id when generating MIDI elements (caused exception when errors in %%score)
- issue warning message when illegal user defined characters are used (X,Y,Z,x,y,z)
- use correct xml-syntax for credit elements (was wrong in version 47)
- translate explicit alterations for non traditional keys
(non traditional key signatures not supported by MuseScore, but note alterations are correct)
- skip more illegal symbols in stead of issuing parse error

Version 47
- translate middle=<pitch> in clefs
- translate transpose=<semitones> in clefs (also %%MIDI transpose is recognised)

- an abc file with multiple tunes can be converted to a set of musicxml files.
- new command line option "-m SKIP NUM" to set the range of tunes to be converted for large abc files.
- leading dot was skipped when parsing a float in page format settings (.5in -> 5in)
- accept [r:] syntax for remarks (caused syntax error previously)
- relax syntax for user defined symbols (allowed character set was needlessly restricted)
- all abc meta-info fields are translated to credit tags (with type)

Version 46

Version 43
- more non standard bar lines recognized (e.g. :])

Version 40
- when reading a file with multiple tunes only translate the first one
- command line option added for scale, page size and margins
